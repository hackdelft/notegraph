# Notegraph

-What:
You can make notes which are the nodes in the graph. A relation can be created by referring to a note inside a note. Also the graph will now contain this relation.


-How to start (in vsc):
Have npm installed
Install yarn through npm
In frondend, run yarn, then run yarn start


-How to use:
Use the markdown to create your notes. A link between two nodes can be made as follows: [Displayed Text](Link) and this will give a clickable link in the text.
